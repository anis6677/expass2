Hei 

Task 2 was more difficult and demanding. I spent more days fixing this. 
I had to find out a lot of things and read a lot of literature to understand what I was doing.
Typical PollApp include:

Creating polls: Users can generate questions with multiple-choice answers.
Sharing polls: Polls can be distributed via links or email
Voting: Participants can cast their votes anonymously or with authentication.
Real-time results: Votes are typically collected in real-time.
Analytics: Some apps provide additional insights.
PollApp can be used in various contexts

I have learned a lot about the domain role and I think such a framework SpringBoot. 
Understand that we learned part of the life cycle, 
added new folder to new controller at the same time get, create, take in return objects. 
URL that binds to HTTP and URI a kind of indicator to objects that are on data an image as a rule,
generate things, identify and filter

I have created a simple REST API (CRUD interface) for the domain model above, i.e. handlers to get 
( @GetMapping), create ( @PostMapping), update ( @PutMapping) and delete ( @DeleteMapping) for Users, 
Polls, VoteOptions , 
and Votes in respective controller classes (annotated with @RestController).

The technical problems that had during the installation it was the whole process with domain protocols here 
I used the help of YouTube to understand my errors and  how I could solve them.
